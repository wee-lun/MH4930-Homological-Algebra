\textbf{Exercise 61} Thie exericse defines the connecting homomorphism $\delta_n$ in Theorem 17.2 (The Long Exact Sequence in Cohomology). Let $0\to X\xto{\alpha}Y\xto{\beta} Z \to 0 $ be a SES of cochain complexes. Let $\alpha\in H^n(Z)$ and $a=z + \im d_n$ where $z\in \ker d_{n+1} :Z^n \to Z^{n+1}$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that there exists $y\in Y^n$ such that $\beta_n(y) = z$ and a unique $x\in \ker d_{n+2}\subseteq X^{n+1}$ such that $\alpha(x) = d(y)$.
    \item Let $z = \im d_n = z' + \im d_n$, and $y,y', x, x'$ such that $\beta(y)=z, \beta(y')=z', \alpha(x) = d(y)$ and $\alpha(x')=d(y')$. Show that $x + \im d_{n+1} = x' + \im d_{n+1}$.
    \item Conclude that we have a map $\delta_n:H^n(Z) \to H^{n+1}(X)$ defined by $\delta_n(z+\im d_n) = x + \im d_{n+1}$.
    \item Prove that the connecting homomorphism $\delta_n$ is a group homomorphism.
\end{enumerate}
